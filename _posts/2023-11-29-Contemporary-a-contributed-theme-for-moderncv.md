Since 2012, I have been using the [moderncv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv/) LaTeX package to prepare my CV.
The moderncv class noticeably reduces the time required to typeset a nice-looking CV, yet it lacks an eye-catching modern theme.  

In the last few days, I have been reworking my r&eacute;sum&eacute; and I took the chance to write a new theme that looks more up-to-date (see image).
`contemporary` is largely based on the `classic` theme and makes use of PGF/TikZ for some of the decorations.
A pull request for moderncv is up <a href="https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv/pull/108" target="_blank">here</a>.  Enjoy!
