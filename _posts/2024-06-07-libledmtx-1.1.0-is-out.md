title: 'libledmtx-1.1.0 is out'

As mentioned a few weeks ago, a number of new features were planned for libledmtx.  This short follow-up post is an announcement of those features being officially available as of today.
The new version has been tagged `libledmtx-1.1.0`.  In particular, it brings:

- Support for double buffer (see documentation for [`ledmtx_setbackbuffer()`](https://github.com/jalopezg-git/libledmtx/blob/master/include/ledmtx_core.h#L191) and `ledmtx_swapbuffers()`).
- Allow for user-defined viewport (see [`ledmtx_setviewport()`](https://github.com/jalopezg-git/libledmtx/blob/master/include/ledmtx_core.h#L147)).  This makes it possible to allocate a larger framebuffer than the physical display and change the visible surface as many times as needed.
- Small optimizations regarding CPU time and access bank memory usage.
- A test suite based on _lit_ and _gpsim_.
