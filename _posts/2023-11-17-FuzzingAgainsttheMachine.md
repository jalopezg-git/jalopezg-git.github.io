Some months ago, my friends Antonio Nappa ([@jeppojeps](https://github.com/jeppojeps)) and Eduardo Bl√°zquez ([@Fare9](https://github.com/Fare9)) finally released the book _"Fuzzing Against the Machine"_, for which I had the pleasure to write a foreword.
The book covers fuzzing of embedded systems' firmware leveraging tools such as QEMU and AFL / AFL++, with practical examples of vulnerability discovery on iOS, Android, and Samsung's Mobile Baseband software, Shannon.

If you are interested in the topic, do not hesitate to take a look.
The book is available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Fuzzing-Against-Machine-Automate-vulnerability/dp/1804614971) and [Direct Digital (Packt)](https://www.packtpub.com/product/fuzzing-against-the-machine/9781804614976).
