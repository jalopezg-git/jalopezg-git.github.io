Welcome to Javier Lopez-Gomez's personal page :wave:!
I'm a HPC software engineer, Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology, and exCERNie ([@root-project](https://github.com/root-project/)), passionate about C++, OS internals, and compiler design / implementation.<br/>
You can read a bit more about me [here](/about).
A summarized version of the CV (r&eacute;sum&eacute;) can be downloaded [here](/public/resume_en-US.pdf).

Ideally, this site will also host posts about a number of interesting topics.
