Back in 2019, during my doctoral studies, I was asked a number of git-related questions here and there by some members of the research group.
Thus, I decided to prepare a slide deck for a talk/workshop to boost casual users' knowledge.
The talk covers git foundational concepts (e.g., blob / tree / commit objects, refs, index), as well as a quick overview of usual porcelain commands and scratching the surface of the plumbing layer.

Due to the general interest, the talk was given not only for the members of the [ARCOS-UC3M](https://github.com/arcosuc3m) research group, but also for other audiences.
The slides are up [here](https://github.com/jalopezg-git/Git_There-Be-Dragons/raw/master/GitTalk.pdf), just in case it can help other people :slightly_smiling_face:!
