title: 'Interesting reads on development in kernel-mode'
---

This short post is about giving kudos to those books on the intricacies of kernel-mode that had an enormous impact on me and that were especially relevant for the implementation of my B.Sc. thesis around a decade ago.
Without further ado, here is the list:

- [_Understanding the Linux kernel_](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Linux-Kernel-Third-Daniel/dp/0596005652): describes foundational concepts of the Intel x86 architecture and a in-depth view of the design of the Linux kernel.  While the 3rd edition applied for Linux 2.6, it is still a valuable source of information.
- [_Linux Device Drivers_](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Device-Drivers-Jonathan-Corbet/dp/0596005903): this book can be seen as the practical counterpart of the previous book.
- [_Designing BSD Rootkits: An Introduction to Kernel Hacking_](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-BSD-Rootkits-Introduction-Hacking/dp/1593271425): one of the books that impressed me the most.  Short and to the point explanation of rootkit mechanics, e.g. direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM) and kernel object hooking.

Happy reading!
